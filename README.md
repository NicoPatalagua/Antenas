# What is a antenna? 🤔
_An antenna is a normally metallic conductive device, since there are salt water antennas, designed with the aim of emitting and / or receiving electromagnetic waves into free space. A transmitting antenna transforms electrical energy into electromagnetic waves, and a receiving antenna performs the reverse function._
